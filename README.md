# Social_Network_API_NoSQL

## Description
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.
This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. 
I've used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

## Criteria
* By entering the command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
* By opening API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* By testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, you're able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database
* By testing API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia,you're able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

## Installation
* Copy the repository to your system
* npm install
* node server.js

## Technologies
* Express.js
* Node.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose ODM

## Usage
* This application will allow users to share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list with a NoSQL Database, MongoDB
